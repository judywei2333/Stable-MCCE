Crystal structure of hen egg white lysozyme - PDB ID 3WUM The residue GLU 35 and ASP 52 have been identified as two active sites. The pKas of these two residues play an important role in the enzyme's activity. In order for lysozyme to attack the glucose molecule of the substrate, GLU has high pKa and ASP 52 has low pKa. This way GLU 35 acts a proton donor, cuts the glucose with protonation of the glycosidic oxygen and a deprotonated GLU 52 stabilizes the highly charged intermediate, making the reaction easier.

At the end of the line, the key string word is enclosed in a pair of parenthesis. The key string must be one word. If a key is detected from a line, the first word of the line is its value. For example: f step 1 : pre - run , pdb -> mcce pdb ( DO_PREMCCE ) The key is \"DO_MCCE\" and the value is \"f\". Lines other than parameter lines are considered as comment lines, therefore ignored. Most commonly edited entries \u00b6 Input and output \u00b6 prot . pdb ( INPDB ) Th parameter \"INPDB\" specifies a pdb file as the initial input structure. Major mcce steps \u00b6 MCCE can be divided into four steps. The steps have keys: DO_PREMCCE DO_ROTAMERS DO_ENERGY DO_MONTE The value 't' is for true (do), and 'f' is for false (not do). Steps : f step 1 : pre - run , pdb -> mcce pdb ( DO_PREMCCE ) f step 2 : make rotatmers ( DO_ROTAMERS ) f step 3 : do energy calculations ( DO_ENERGY ) f step 4 : monte carlo sampling ( DO_MONTE ) The later step depends on the out put of previous step. Less edited entries \u00b6 Step 2 and step 4 have more flexibility and are customized more often than others. General \u00b6 4 . 0 Protein dielectric constant for DelPhi ( EPSILON_PROT ) Dielectric constant of protein. Usually epsilon 8 is used for small soluble protein (~100 residues), and 4 is used for big trans-membrane protein (> 200 residues). This value is used by step 2 to optimize rotamers and step 3 to compute energy table. / home / mcce / Stable - MCCE / extra . tpl ( EXTRA ) This file contains entries that overwrite those defined in ftpl and tpl files in param/ directory, and extral controls over the program. The extra controls are in two categories: offset energy of ionizable residues. These energy corrects the residue solution pKa values based on previous benchmarks. The scaling factor of van der Walls energy term. The recommended values are the inverse of dielectric constant defined by EPSILON_PROT. / home / mcce / Stable - MCCE / name . txt MCCE renaming rule . ( RENAME_RULES ) The renaming rule can divide a big group into separate ionizable groups. put ligands and cofactor as one group. This is done by renaming the atom and residue.
